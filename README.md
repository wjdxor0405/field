# field

This project tried to implement 
[field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics))
, especially, 
[Algebraic number field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number_field)

For example, $x^2 - 2$
has two solutions
$\sqrt{2}$ 
 and 
$-\sqrt{2}$.

Notice that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})=\mathbb{Q}(-\sqrt{2})= \\{ a+b\sqrt{2} | a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \\}$ so the field generated by $x^2 - 2$ is unique and C++ code will be
```C++
Number_field N = Number_field(Poly(1,2) - Poly(2));
```

Each Poly(1,2) and Poly(2) means 
$x^2$
and
constant term $2$ in the polynomial.

Polynomial operations like addtion, substitution, multiplication and division are available.

Polynomial modulo operator also available. Auto-modulo calculation is provided to support 
[minial polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_polynomial_(field_theory))
.

'Number_field' is defined as class, which contains informations like 
[minial polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_polynomial_(field_theory))
